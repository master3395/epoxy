#Epoxy
## an open source web proxy

epoxy is a fork of the fantastic PHPProxy (also known as poxy on Sourceforge) project led by Abdullah Arif, which development was unfortunately halted in 2007.

The entire project is under the GNU GPL- see the LICENSE.txt file that should be included with this file.

The goal of epoxy is to offer a simple script to deploy on any web server that allows anyone to access websites from locations where there might be an artificial limitation in place (think China, Turkey, etc.).

Unlimited free access to human culture and knowledge should be a human right. Please deploy epoxy on your server, contribute to the code if you can and spread the word!
